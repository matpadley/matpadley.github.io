In addition I came up with a process to split the entire solution logically into its business components to simplify development deployment in Azure DevOps, but this has not been actioned.

### BLM
Architect Team Lead - 2017-2028

Enhancing the bespoke case management system was my main role here. This was written using Web API 2 and Typescript (with Angular) utilising a SQL Server database. Developing the workflows (Part 8, Part 18, Part 20, Offers, Payments, Pre-Litigation and Settlements) was quite cumbersome. Both myself and a colleague introduced a num- ber of improvements to the process to streamline this and reduce the dev to test cycle.

I was also squad lead for another two to three developers having to manage sprint workloads and queries about the work being done. In this process I was responsible for developing the domain models whilst the other squad members wrote the actual workflows.

### Vodafone
Senior Software Engineer - 2014-2016

My initial role was to work as part of a small team to add new features to a SME app that was architected around BackboneJS, CQRS, Event Sourcing, RabbitMQ, RavenDB and SQL Server. This was re-worked into a WebAPI (including OWIN) back-end and Angular front-end. The domain layer was kept fairly simple but, soon grew more complicated to work in.

The AngularJS, introduced by myself, portion of the project was tested using Protractor tests (myself and another developer put this framework in) and Jasmine within a Team City release pipeline.

### NHS
Senior Software Engineer - 2013-2014

CMFT required a new patient record system, and there was no third party application that met their requirements. I was then brought in house to develop this with a small team. We designed a system based on an ASP.NET 4 front end, WCF backend and SQL Server database. User interface elements were designed using Kendo UI and jQuery. Later in the project I introduced Angular JS to manage some of the more com- plex screens.

In three months we had developed a system from the ground up that would integrate (using HL7 messaging) with other hospital systems, had a simple form system and ba- sic user authentication. By the time I left the project this had moved onto consultants having the ability to view patient paperwork in the application.

### Go Outdoors
Senior Software Engineer - 2013-2013

Part of the business relied heavily on a very over-worked Excel spreadsheet. On my arrival I was tasked with making this simpler to use. All numeric work was originally done using formulas.

Senior Software Engineer - 2013-2013

We Buy Any Car required a system whereby dealers could view and bid (via online auctions) for vehicles from multiple suppliers (Manheim, BCA etc).

Originally data was held in an Access database that I migrated this into SQL Server over which sat an ASP.NET WCF layer over this using Dapper for the ORM. A MVC4 front end dealt with user authentication being dealt with using ASP.NET membership providers.

# Mathew R. Padley

I have working across many industries (travel, health, finance, communications) which has led to working with different team types and people across the world. My main skill set is within the Microsoft software.

The past few years has seen with extenviely working with the CI/CD world specifically and Github and TeamCity. Providing guidance on migration from BitBucket and TeamCity to GitHub universe.

During my working life the solution myself and the team at Inventive IT created was the most fulfilling. We worked from a whiteboard sketch to a fulling working system in about a year. This involved weekly software reviews and working with a University to try and automate a pricing model (ML was not a real industry wide entity at this point). On the first test of the entire system, which included inventory management, customer booking and third party integration everything went according to plan.

### Insight Investment
#### DevOps Engineer - 2022 - 2024

- Investigate and replace existing CI/CD solution with a new one, in this case GitHub
- Migrated over 2,500 git repositories in BitBucket and deployment of GitHub Advanced Security across these
- The company needed to make the developer experience better and also the license cost of the GitHub solution was more favourable

<p>Part of a team tasked with migrating the companies existing source control and ci/cd pipeline to GitHub from BitBucket and TeamCity (cloud and on-prem). This involved writing various scripts (PowerShell) to aid in the migration as well as other smaller tooling to get this process finished.</p>

#### Senior Software Craftsperson - 2021 - 2022

- Adding new functionality to an end clients medical delivery system
- A lot of code analysis to understand the brownfield software structure and working within this to add new code that was easily maintainable
- The client did not have the capacity to complete the work they needed to do

<p>Feature lead for the API team using .net framework and some Blazor. We had to liaise with the customer regarding requirements and also the internal BA sometimes having to explain complex technical reasons for design decisions. In addition I came up with a process to split the entire solution logically into its business components to simplify development deployment in Azure DevOps, but this has not been actioned.</p>

### BLM
#### Architect Team Lead - 2017-2028

- Added features and process to existing legal workflow system
- Wrote new Visual Sudio and Visual Studio Code templates to automate portions of the workflow create process
- The test team were creating bugs that could have been mitigated if more attention was paid to the code

<p>Enhancing the bespoke case management system was my main role here. This was written using Web API 2 and Typescript (with Angular) utilising a SQL Server database. Developing the workflows (Part 8, Part 18, Part 20, Offers, Payments, Pre-Litigation and Settlements) was quite cumbersome. Both myself and a colleague introduced a num- ber of improvements to the process to streamline this and reduce the dev to test cycle.</p><p>I was also squad lead for another two to three developers having to manage sprint workloads and queries about the work being done. In this process I was responsible for developing the domain models whilst the other squad members wrote the actual workflows.</p>

### Vodafone
#### Senior Software Engineer - 2014-2016

<p>My initial role was to work as part of a small team to add new features to a SME app that was architected around BackboneJS, CQRS, Event Sourcing, RabbitMQ, RavenDB and SQL Server. This was re-worked into a WebAPI (including OWIN) back-end and Angular front-end. The domain layer was kept fairly simple but, soon grew more complicated to work in.</p><p>The AngularJS, introduced by myself, portion of the project was tested using Protractor tests (myself and another developer put this framework in) and Jasmine within a Team City release pipeline.



### NHS
#### Senior Software Engineer - 2013-2014

- Worked within a small teams to develop a custom patient record system
- Creating an Angular 2 application and ntegrating this into NHAPI patiend records messaging
- Giving the hospital a fully customisable product

<p>CMFT required a new patient record system, and there was no third party application that met their requirements. I was then brought in house to develop this with a small team. We designed a system based on an ASP.NET 4 front end, WCF backend and SQL Server database. User interface elements were designed using Kendo UI and jQuery. Later in the project I introduced Angular JS to manage some of the more com- plex screens.</p><p>In three months we had developed a system from the ground up that would integrate (using HL7 messaging) with other hospital systems, had a simple form system and ba- sic user authentication. By the time I left the project this had moved onto consultants having the ability to view patient paperwork in the application.</p>

### Go Outdoors

- Simplified their product ordering process
- Keeping their existing data platform and simplifying it using VBA Script in Excel
- This then gave the product teams the ability concentrate on products that order flow

<p>Part of the business relied heavily on a very over-worked Excel spreadsheet. On my arrival I was tasked with making this simpler to use. All numeric work was originally done using formulas. This was replaced with a COM object using the Microsoft Office Interop libraries. Validation was replaced by using FluentValidation.</p>

A MVC4 front end dealt with user authentication being dealt with using ASP.NET membership providers.</p>

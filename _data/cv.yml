experiences:
    - I have working across many industries (travel, health, finance, communications) which has led to working with different team types and people across the world. My main skill set is within the Microsoft software. 
    - The past few years has seen with extenviely working with the CI/CD world specifically and Github and TeamCity. Providing guidance on migration from BitBucket and TeamCity to GitHub universe.
    - During my working life the solution myself and the team at Inventive IT created was the most fulfilling. We worked from a whiteboard sketch to a fulling working system in about a year. This involved weekly software reviews and working with a University to try and automate a pricing model (ML was not a real industry wide entity at this point). On the first test of the entire system, which included inventory management, customer booking and third party integration everything went according to plan.

        - Together with a colleague, I introduced several improvements to streamline this process and reduce the development-to-testing cycle. Additionally, I served as the squad lead for a team of two to three developers, managing sprint workloads and addressing queries about ongoing work. In this capacity, I was responsible for developing the domain models, while the other squad members focused on implementing the workflows."

While the domain layer started as relatively simple, it gradually became more complex over time.
        - The AngularJS portion of the project, which I introduced, was tested using Protractor (a testing framework implemented by myself and another developer) and Jasmine, integrated into a TeamCity release pipeline."

        - CMFT required a new patient record system, as no third-party application met their requirements. I was brought in-house to develop this system as part of a small team. We designed the system with an ASP.NET 4 front end, a WCF back end, and a SQL Server database. The user interface elements were created using Kendo UI and jQuery. Later in the project, I introduced AngularJS to manage some of the more complex screens.
        - Within three months, we had developed a system from the ground up that integrated with other hospital systems using HL7 messaging. It included a simple form system and basic user authentication. By the time I left the project, the system had advanced to allow consultants to view patient paperwork directly within the application.
